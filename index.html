        <h2 class="headers"> Boltz Application </h2>

        <p>Boltz is an educational childrens application that promotes energy conservation. The app was developed in collaboration with Neurio Technologies for the final engineering project of my degree.</p>
<p>
The application features a game and a quiz about energy conservation shown in the video I made below. The application also rewards an in-game currency based on the amount of electricity being used in your house as measured by Neurio's monitoring system.</p>

      </div>
<p>
I led a small group of engineers in the development of the app. This included delegating tasks among the group as well as deciding on the scope of the project and goals. As the most experienced programmer on the team I also took the lead in the development of the application, focusing on the game and quiz mechanics. We regularly met with the client to ensure goals were being met and assessed. </p>
<p>
The app was developed in C# using Unity, a powerful cross-platform game engine that simplified the development by providing a solid base for the game. The art was created specifically for the project by a team member using assets and colors from the client. </p>
<p>
A user could log into the app using their Neurio ID, which would let the app know the current wattage being used in the house.  Children could turn off lights and electronic not being used to reduce their household power usage, promoting energy conservation and increasing their in-game currency.  This was done by accessing the Neurio API using the application to receive a JSON packet filled with information about the home and the power usage inside it.  We parsed the packet to receive the current wattage of the system and rewarded a currency based on how low the power being used was.</p>
<p>
We wanted to test the application on our target demographic.  We designed a presentation about energy conservation, followed by a demonstration and test of the application with children in a local Vancouver elementary school</p>
<p>
The project is considered complete and was delivered to the client, however if more time and hours were available to work on it I would have liked to add levels with increasing difficulty and more polish to the project, such as customized menu buttons added to create a cohesive UI.

   <!--Discord Bot Content -->

    <div id="discord">
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="headers"> Discord Bot </h2>
            <p>Discord is a popular VoIP application my friends and I use extensively.  I thought it would be a fun project to make an automated user to practice my coding abilities and learn about Node.js, the Discord API and numerous node packages created by other programmers used to create my project.  </p>
            <p>The bot can be invited to a server with the link below if you are familiar with discord.  </p>

            <div><a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=542416964614619137&permissions=0&scope=bot"><img alt="discord bot install link" id="botimg" src="images/yeBot.png"></a></div>

            <p>The bot contains all the standard commands provided by the Discord library as well as several custom commands I wrote for it.  I wrote a simple implementation of roulette, as well as blackjack.  These games are played using a currency earned by sending messages in the server, and each user’s currency count is stored on a JSON file.  You can check your currency balance with a command as well as play music from a youtube video, streamed to the server through the included voice chat.  This is able to be done thanks to several node.js packages made available through npm thanks to the programmers who created them.  The bot is currently being hosted on a Raspberry Pi 2 running the Raspbian operating system.  I plan to add more functionality to the bot, such as a wider variety of games, and other fun commands. </p>

        <p>As a fan of arcades and fighting games, I really enjoyed building this arcade style fightstick using an Arduino and custom wiring design.  The arduino is running UnoJoy, and reflashed firmware to be recognized as a DirectInput controller which I found
            <a href="https://github.com/AlanChatham/UnoJoy">here.</a>  I designed and built the circuit on a breadboard.  I decided to use Colored LEDs on a breadboard as a visual component for the project and added circuitry.  Each LED needs a resistor to limit current, otherwise it will burn out the LED and could damage the Arduino.</p>

        <p>There is a 5V line to power the LEDs and the buttons and joysticks are grounded, when an Arduino digital pin receives a grounded signal it sends the input to the computer.  Some further improvements I plan on making include changing the box to a much larger size to make more room for the circuitry and adding two more buttons for custom keybinds.  I also plan on designing a gerber file for PCB printing to practice planning circuit boards.</p>
